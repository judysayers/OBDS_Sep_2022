    "This is toy problem where we know the answer before we start. The point of this example is understand overall process of iterative improvement. Relationships typically being modelled with ML are more complicated than a simple multiplier, but suprisingly little changes for more complex problems. Here we're modelling a single parameter, but many models used in biology have 10s of millions, but are built out of many simple calculations like our exercise. The math is more advanced (but maybe not as much as you might think) and beyond our scope, but wouldn't serve much practical use anyway since these calculations are never ever done by hand, and a comprehensive understanding of them is not strictly necessary unless researching novel algorithm designs."
